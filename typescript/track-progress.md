# Track Progress

Due to the lack of mentors on the typescript track I've had to consistently switch between *independent mode* and *mentored mode*.

* **Independent** because I can mark solutions as *complete* when passing all test suites.
* **Mentored** because there are related *Side Exercises* to the major exercises, and the track is organized in more visually pleasing manner.

For ease of readng on this list I'll be adding an 'L' + number as they appear in the [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io/tracks/typescript) *MENTORED* track itself, with the first entry below the heading as the major exercise

**Update** 2019-10-01: I cannot switch between modes any longer do to a notice that "*... This track is currently oversubscribed and only available in Practice Mode*" and as a result of this I am now unable to view the *Mentored* track layout. I'm now going to continue to work my way through the exercises in ascending difficulty order.
