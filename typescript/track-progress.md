# Track Progress

Due to the lack of mentors on the typescript track I've had to consistently switch between *independent mode* and *mentored mode*.

* **Independent** because I can mark solutions as *complete* when passing all test suites.
* **Mentored** because there are related *Side Exercises* to the major exercises, and the track is organized in more visually pleasing manner.

For ease of readng on this list I'll be adding an 'L' + number as they appear in the [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io/tracks/typescript) track itself, with the first entry below the heading as the major exercise
